    <!--ABOUT-->
         <h3 align="center" class="form"  id="head_text">POLICIES</h3>
        <p id="about"></p>
        <p align="center" id="head_text">
        <ul id="about_li">
        <h3 align="center">Mission Statement (Program)</h3><li><p>It is the philosophy of Audette’s Academy for Early Learning that children should experience happiness and success.  Children are natural resources and should be nurtured in an atmosphere that is comfortable, safe, and secure.  Children learn through many activities, including play and interacting with others. The purpose and mission of the center are to promote a social, physical, and emotional development of young children through planned activities and group interactions by creating a loving and learning environment in which children will be prepared for a smooth entry into the school system.</p></li>
        <h3 align="center">Non-Restrictive Admission Policy</h3><li><p>Audette’s Academy does not discriminate against anyone regardless of race, creed, religion, nationality, or any children with special needs.</p></li>
        <h3 align="center">Open Door Policy</h3><li><p>You are welcome to visit the center at any time. As an important security measure, we ask that you bring your child into the center and see that he or she is under supervision before you leave the center. Equally important is that you re-enter the building when picking up your child at the end of the day. Please note that the center is not to  be used as a visitation site and the open door policy applies only to custodial parents. We are required by law to report suspected child abuse or neglect to the proper authorities. To ensure the safety of our children and staff, we have a door bell that parents should ring to access the center.</p></li>
        <h3 align="center">Procedures for Safe Pick and Delivery</h3><li><p>When you pick up your child in the morning please make sure you sign him or her in, and in the evening you sign him or her out, and alert the staff to the child's leaving. We realize some of your work schedules may be longer than the hours your child is in daycare, so please make arrangements for family members or friends to pick your child at the appropriate tiime. Also keep in mind that children become tired and restless when they have to stay long hours.</p></li>
          <h3 align="center">Pick Up or Release of Children</h3><li><p>Your child will only be released to you or to the persons whose names are on your emergency information card. Under no circumstances will anyone else be allowed to pick up your child unless we have direct permission from you.

Children shall only be released to a responsible designated person in accordance with the child release plan required by these Department of Human Services rules:
	The agency shall verify the identity of the authorized person by requiring presentation of photo identification. 

The person to whom the child is released must sign the child out of the agency.

Children shall not be released to anyone whose behavior may, as deemed by a reasonable person, place the child in imminent risk, provided, however, that if the agency reasonably believes that refusal to release the child could place staff or other children in imminent risk, the agency may release the child, but must immediately call 911 or other local emergency services’ numbers.
</p></li>
          <h3 align="center">Duty to Report</h3><li><p>Every operator, owner, licensee, director, or staff member or a substitute staff member or volunteer in a child care agency licensed by the Department of Human Services is individually responsible and required by Tennessee code annotated to immediately report any reasonable suspicion of child abuse or neglect to the Department of Children’s Services, local law enforcement or the judge of the juvenile court in the county of child’s residence.</p></li>
          <h3 align="center">Safety Policy</h3><li><p>No child will be left unsupervised.  Fire drills will take place monthly at varying times and supervised by either the Director or the lead teacher.  The safety rules are taught to the children and practiced by the staff.
The safety rules are as follows:

o	No aerosol sprays are permitted to be used by any person in the presence of children.

o	Each child must be walked to the door upon arrival or picked up by a parent or responsible person each day.

o	Our center has immediate access to a working telephone within the building at all time for use for your child’s safety.

o	The center has a plan posted in the classroom which explains the actions and staff responsibilities in case of fire or weather alerts.

o	There is a first-aid kit in each classroom as well as in the office.
</p></li>
          <h3 align="center">Incident Report</h3><li><p>When an accident or injury occurs, the center completes an accident/injury report and gives the parent a copy of the report and keeps a copy on file at the center the day of accident/injury. When your child arrives at the center, we also check for any injuries that might have occurred while at home. There are times accidents happen at home, and parents do not make us aware of the injury. In this case, an injury report is also completed in two copies; one for the parent and the other for the center.
</p></li>
          <h3 align="center">Late Pick Up Policy</h3><li><p>Your child must be picked up before or at 5:00 pm at the latest, depending on the drop off time for each child.  No child is allowed to stay at the center for a period longer than nine hours per day.  A charge of $5.00 for the first minute and of $ 1.00 for each additional minute subsequently will go into effect after the nine hours.  However, if a child is dropped off at 9:00, he or she must be picked up before or at 5:00, the closing time.  This late fee will be due at the time of pick up or the following morning, and the child will not return until the money is paid.  No exceptions will be made.</p></li>
          <h3 align="center">Illness Policy</h3><li><p>Parents are expected to bring their child into the center for a brief health check if the child is thought to be ill or has other complications.  Sick children cannot be cared for at the center.  If a child becomes ill during the day, the parents will be called to come take the child home.  Children absent due to a contagious disease may not return to the center without a signed statement from a physician indicating the child is no longer contagious and can return to center activities.</p></li>
          <h3 align="center">Termination Policy</h3><li><p>A child may be released from the center for the following reasons:
1. Parent’s request — please make a written request two (2) weeks in advance.
2. Excessive late pick-ups.
3. Excessive late payments.
4. Child’s behavior endangers the safety of other children.
5. Parents negative behavior/attitude toward the staff.

</p></li>
          <h3 align="center">Inclement Weather Policy</h3><li><p>In the event of ice, sleet or snow, the staff at Audette's Academy for Early Learning will make every effort to maintain the normal operational hours. However, if businesses and public schools are closed due to hazardous road or conditions, the center may close early or possibly not open. You may check for closings and delays on WBBJ-TV Channel 7, WFFX 95.7 radio, and WOJG 94.7 radio.</p>
          </li>
          <h3 align="center">Outside Policy</h3><li><p>Children are required by state law to go outdoors at least 30 minutes a day.  If in the instance it is too cold or raining, indoor activities will be planned.  Please dress your child according to the weather.</p></li>
