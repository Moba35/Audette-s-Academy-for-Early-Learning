# Audette-s-Academy-for-Early-Learning
the purpose of the site is to advertise and inform people about the daycare
Our client gave us the task of creating a website for their daycare. 
They wanted us to include pictures of the children in the daycare, their policies, 
location, contact information, hours, and hiring information. We made sure to make
our website looks like a daycare website. we only used primary colors to give
it a daycare feel. We created a logo, which is a picture of blocks with letters on 
them. 
	**Policies**
Our clients gave us a list of policies that we had to include on the website.
These policies included A mission statement, a non-restrictive admission policy, 
open door policy, procedures for safe pick and delivery, pick up and release of 
children, duty to report, safety policy, incident policy, late pick policy, 
termination policy, and an outside policy.
	**Schedule**
They also gave us a schedule that they wanted in the website. It is 
a list of times when they do specific activities. 
	**Location and About**
They wanted to include the location of the daycare. We put the google map directions 
and picture of the daycare on the website so that people could find it. The client 
include a page in the website that gave a little insight about the daycare.
	**Now Hirring**
The client also wanted us to include a page where people could apply to work there. 
We included an application link that people can save and print.
	**Header**
One of the request that the clients had about the header was that
we include their names in the header along with the name of the daycare and director. 
	**Footer**
We also created a footer for the website which include a link the facebook and twitter of the 
daycare as well. We decided to put those links in the footer. We also put
a link to the daycare's e-mail in the footer. We also put a schedule and another 
navigation bar in the footer to select different pages when you scroll to the bottom
of the website. We tried to the best if  our ability to make the website responsive,
but unfortunately were unable to make it responsive. As a reult the website only 
has a decent display on a mac or desktop view.
